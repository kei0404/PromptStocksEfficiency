# Assets

This directory contains the app assets including icons and splash screens.

For now, these are placeholder files. In a production app, you would replace these with actual designed assets.

Required files:
- icon.png (1024x1024)
- splash.png (varies by platform)
- adaptive-icon.png (Android adaptive icon)
- favicon.png (Web favicon)
